        <h2>Quranic Reflections</h2>
        <div class="verse">
            <p><em>"And be patient, for indeed, Allah is with those who are patient." (Surah Al-Anfal, 8:46)</em></p>
            <p>This verse teaches us the importance of patience (Sabr), a quality Maximus embodies in times of hardship.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <p><em>"Do not kill yourselves. Indeed, Allah is ever Merciful to you." (Surah An-Nisa, 4:29)</em></p>
            <p>Maximus’ resilience in the face of despair reflects a mindset of endurance, echoing Allah’s command to never give up hope.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <p><em>"So be patient. Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth." (Surah Ar-Rum, 30:60)</em></p>
            <p>Patience (Sabr) is not only a virtue but also a promise from Allah, which we must believe in, just as Maximus believed in his ultimate victory.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <p><em>"Do not grieve; indeed Allah is with us." (Surah At-Tawbah, 9:40)</em></p>
            <p>Maximus’ journey mirrors the struggle of many Muslims who face hardship and loss, but through faith, we remember that Allah is always with us.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <p><em>"And whoever fears Allah... He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty)." (Surah At-Talaq, 65:2)</em></p>
            <p>Maximus demonstrated great fearlessness and resolve; in the same way, the Quran encourages us to fear Allah, and He will guide us through challenges.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Prophet Muhammad's Example</h2>
        <p>The Prophet (ﷺ) showed incredible courage in battle, not for fame, but to protect the truth and establish justice. He exemplified the virtues of Maximus, showing resilience in the face of hardship.</p>
        <p>He lived a life of submission (Islam), patience (Sabr), and integrity, which is a source of inspiration for Muslims facing adversity today.</p>
